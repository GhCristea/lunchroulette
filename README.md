Lunchroulette helps you decide where to have lunch by randomly picking a restaurant in your area. Open [the website](https://soyguijarro.github.io/lunchroulette) and tap the _I'm feeling lucky_ button to get a random restaurant nearby. Press on the walking distance information at the bottom to open the location in Google Maps, or tap the refresh button at the top right to get another suggestion.


## Technology

The web app is build with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). Styles are written in plain CSS and automatically prefixed with [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer). [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) is used for transpiling and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) for module bundling. [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) was used to take care of all this tooling. The site is hosted in [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and deployed with [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages)'s command line utility through a simple npm script.


## Acknowledgments

The design of the web app is heavily inspired by the [Material design](https://material.google.com/) guidelines in general and the [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com) interface in particular. The app icon was generated with help of [Android Material Icon Generator](https://android-material-icon-generator.bitdroid.de/).
